Lets start from the very basic question of what coding is or what software engineers actually do.
_Coding or Software Engineering is just manipulating the data.
_Move data from one place to another place is what software engineers do.

What's a data structure?
_Data Structures are used to organize, structure and manage data.
_Data Structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions, operations that can be applied on the data.

Complexity Analysis?
_Complexity Analysis determines how efficient an algorithm is.

Time Complexity?
_Measure of how fast an alorithm runs. It is expressed in Big O notation.

Space Somplexity?
_Measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up. It is expressed in Big O notation.

These are the standard definitons found everywhere on the internet. Let's take a deep dive into it and understand what these terms mean at the basic level i.e the memory level.

Imagine Memory as a canvas sheet!

What do we check in order to store data in the memory canvas?
_If there is free memeory slot to store.
_If there are consecutive memeory slots to store.
_THe way to store data in the memeory canvas depends on the endianness followed.

Endianness?
_Endianness means ordering of bytes.
_Endianness means that the bytes in computer memory are read in a certain order either from left to right which is big endian or right to left which is little endian.


why is it important?
_So knowledge of endianness is important when you are reading and writing the data across the network from one system to another.
