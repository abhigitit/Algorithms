Lets start from the very basic question of what coding is or what software engineers actually do.
_Coding or Software Engineering is just manipulating the data.
_Move data from one place to another place is what software engineers do.

What's a data structure?
_Data Structures are used to organize, structure and manage data.
_Data Structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions, operations that can be applied on the data.

Complexity Analysis?
_Complexity Analysis determines how efficient an algorithm is.

Time Complexity?
_Measure of how fast an alorithm runs. It is expressed in Big O notation.

Space Somplexity?
_Measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up. It is expressed in Big O notation.

These are the standard definitons found everywhere on the internet. Let's take a deep dive into it and understand what these terms mean at the basic level i.e the memory level.

Imagine Memory as a canvas sheet!
