Logarithm:

log2(N) = x iff 2^x=N
We deal with binary log in computer science.

2^x = N
When N is doubled, x is increased by 1. 
So, even when N tends to a huge number, x does not increase drastically. Idea behind algorithm development.

8 = 2^3

1073741824 = 2^30


Are we eliminating half of the input size in each step? If yes, we are performing O(logN) operation.
